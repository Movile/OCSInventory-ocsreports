# Extensions Tools

This folder contains the extensions tools.

You will find two different scripts :
* install_plugin.py
* install_plugin_nossh.py

Bascially the two scripts does the same thing.
However, the nossh doesn't propose remove communication server installation and doesn't require SSH et panamiko dependencies
